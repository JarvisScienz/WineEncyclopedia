🎯 Purpose of the Project
Wine Encyclopedia was created to centralize all the available information about wineries and wines in Italy. With thousands of vineyards and a deep history of wine production, finding accurate and detailed information can be a challenge. This project aims to:

🏰 Gather comprehensive information on Italian wineries.
🗺️ Explore wine regions and appellations.
🍽️ Provide pairing suggestions to enhance your dining experience.
📚 Educate users on the nuances of wine production and varieties.
🛠️ Technologies Used
This project leverages modern technologies to provide a seamless and efficient experience for both developers and users:

Backend:

Built with Node.js, the backend handles data aggregation, REST APIs, and the integration with wine databases.

Frontend:

The project features both a React-based frontend and an Angular frontend to provide flexibility in UI design and user experience.

Databases:

These databases store information about the wineries, wine types, and user profiles.

Authentication & Security:
JWT-based authentication ensures secure access for users and admins.

API Architecture:
Utilizes both REST and GraphQL for flexible data querying.
